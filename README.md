## Applied Machine Learning Assessment

The repository contains code used to analyse sequencing data (gene expression matrices) and cell body segmentation data. Data mining approaches were employed to determine the features of the datasets. Following this, two machine learning approaches were applied.

## Part 1

A range of data-mining approaches were applied on three types of 'faulty' datasets. This included the application of clustering approaches and imputation methods. The associated R Markdown document is XXX
